                    Hello! I'm Kalpita Khare, an aspiring design student with a passion for bringing ideas to life through visual storytelling. I create and share my work under my artist pen name, Magarmuchh, which represents my playful and curious approach to art and design.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                    My journey in art has been one of constant exploration â€” from the fine details of sketching to the dynamic world of stop-motion animation.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                    I am currently preparing for competitive design entrance exams like UCEED and NID. This portfolio is a curated collection of my work, showcasing my skills, my creative process, and my dedication to the craft of design.
